# Chapter 1 Foundations of Data Systems

Fundamentals of a data system:
- Reliability
- Scalability
- Maintainabiliity

## Reliability

The ability to work correctly under (certain types of) faults.

**Fault type:**
- Hardware error (disk, network, machine, etc.)
- Software error (code bug)
- Human error

**Fault vs. Failure:**
- Fault: a component of the system deviating its specification
- Failure: the whole system stops to provide service

**Solutions**
- Access control
- Sandbox => for experiments
- CI/CD + Automatic testing: Reduce human involvement in software process
- Monitoring
- Rollout - feature release gradually: distribute to certain user group

## Scalability

The ability to cope with increased load.






## Maintainability
